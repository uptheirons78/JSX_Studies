# JSX Studies

#### 06 june 2019

Today I am focusing on learning (brushing up) as much as possible about JSX.
Basic rules of JSX, embedding js and conditionals in JSX.
It is possible to conditional render an element using both if/else statement or ternary operator (plus other ways I'm going to learn later).
